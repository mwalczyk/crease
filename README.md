## Credits
This project was largely inspired by Jun Mitani's Java application, [ORIPA](http://mitani.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/oripa/) and Erik Demaine's [FOLD](https://github.com/edemaine/fold). Erik Demaine's own crease pattern editor was also a very helpful reference, especially in terms of understanding the interop between SVG elements and planar graphs.
